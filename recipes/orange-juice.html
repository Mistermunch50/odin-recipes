        <h2>Orange juice</h2>
            <p>Fresh orange juice takes a little work, but it tastes 
                much better than orange juice from concentrate. 
                I came up with this recipe in response to a request 
                about how to make fresh-squeezed orange juice. You may 
                also use a citrus reamer to do this. If you want less 
                pulp, use a hand juicer with a strainer.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <!-- list of ingredients and steps -->

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <!-- Steps -->

            <ol>
                <li>Lightly smack each orange on the counter. Cut each 
                    orange in half and squeeze juice into a glass.</li>
            </ol>
